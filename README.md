# bootstrap_resample_with_replacement

## System Docs ðŸ“ƒ
A combination of codes developed for the calculation of the cross-correlation confidence intervals for a pair of light-curves. The project consists of three codes, the ***bootstrap_LC.py*** for creating artificial light-curves by randomly resampling a pair of light-curves with replacement, ***zdcf95_v2.2.f90*** for executing cross-correlation analysis of the pairs of artificial light-curves, ***helloScriptpt.sh*** is used to execute the previous code, and last is ***significance.py***, which reads the artificial cross-correlations to determine 1-sigma, 2-sigma and 3-sigma confidence intervals.
